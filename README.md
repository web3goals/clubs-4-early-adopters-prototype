## ✨ About

It’s a tool that helps developers to boost their web3 application by providing gasless transactions to early adopters.

This way, users have a more enjoyable experience and it motivates them to use the app more often.

## ⚒️ How it's made

To make it, I used

- zkSync network and a custom paymaster contract to provide features for developers to create and operate clubs of early adopters.
- Particle Network for more convenient and faster login of users.
- And FormSubmit as an email provider.

## 🧠 Contracts (zkSync Era Testnet)

- Club Factory - [0xa642D30bF43288Be1E10c999B3e6526879a8E03B](s/0xa642D30bF43288Be1E10c999B3e6526879a8E03B)

## 🚀 Plans

There are many ideas on how to improve this project.

It would be great to:

- Add more form types that will verify social or onchain activity.
- Make collaborations with web3 developers.
- Add additional options for customizing club page.
- Create an SDK that can be used to easily integrate the club into the app.
